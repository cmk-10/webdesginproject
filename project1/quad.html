        <p>Snakes are elongated limbless reptiles of the suborder Serpentes (/sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/).[2] Cladistically squamates,  
            snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales much like other members of the group. 
             Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors and relatives,  
             enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To accommodate their narrow bodies,
              snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most only have one functional lung.  
              Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have independently evolved elongate 
               bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless 
               lizards.[3] These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although 
               this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae)</p>
