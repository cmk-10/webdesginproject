    <p>The incidence and recurrence of hamstrings injuries are very high in sports, posing 
     elevated performance and financial-related costs. Attempts to identify the risk factors 
     involved in predicting vulnerability to hamstrings injury is important for designing 
     exercise-based programs that aim to mitigate the rate and severity of hamstrings injuries
      and improve rehabilitation strategies. However, research has shown that non-modifiable risk factors may
       play a greater role than modifiable risk factors. Recognizing non-modifiable risk factors and understanding their implications
        will afford the prescription of better suited exercise programs, i.e., that are more respectful of the individual characteristics.
         In a nutshell, non-modifiable risk factors can still be acted upon, even if indirectly. In this context, an underexplored topic is
          how intra and inter- individual anatomic and physiologic variations in hamstrings (e.g., muscle bellies, fiber types, tendon length,
           aponeurosis width, attachment sites, sex- and age-related differences) concur to alter hamstrings injuries risk. Some anatomic and
            physiologic variations may be modifiable through exercise interventions (e.g., cross-sectional area), while others may not (e.g.,
             supernumerary muscle bellies). This apparent dichotomy may hide a greater complexity, i.e., there may be risk factors that are partially modifiable.
              Therefore, we explored the available information on the anatomic variations of the hamstrings, providing a deeper insight into the individual risk
               factors for hamstrings injuries and contributing with better knowledge and potential applications toward a more individualized exercise prescription.<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/">learn more</a> </p>

     <img width="300" src="images/weights.jpg" alt="weights"/> <img width="300" src="images/icePack.jpg" alt="icePack"/> 
     <ol> 
     <li>Take a break from strenuous activities to allow the injury to heal.</li> 
     <li>Apply ice packs several times a day to relieve pain and reduce swelling.</li> 
     <li>Wrap the injured area with a compression bandage or wear compression shorts to minimize swelling.</li> 
     <li>Rest with the leg elevated above the level of the heart, if possible, to lessen swelling.</li> 
     <li>Take pain medicine you can get without a prescription. Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).</li>

        <h2>How long the recovery period is</h2>   
        <img width="300" src="images/clock.jpg" alt="clock"/> 
        <p>Recovering from a hamstring injury may take days, weeks or months, depending on how severe it is.
            A completely torn hamstring may take several months to heal and you'll be unable to resume training or play sport during this time.</p>
